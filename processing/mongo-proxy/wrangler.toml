# Mukoko News — MongoDB Proxy Worker
#
# Thin JS Worker that provides MongoDB access via Service Binding.
# Python Workers can't use the MongoDB Node.js driver directly (Pyodide limitation),
# so this Worker acts as an internal bridge.
#
# Deploy: cd processing/mongo-proxy && npx wrangler deploy
# The Python Worker connects via Service Binding (MONGO binding).
